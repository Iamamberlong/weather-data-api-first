üß© Features

RESTful API Architecture

CRUD operations for Weather Data and Users.

Supports both single and batch sensor data insertion.

User Authentication & Authorization

Role-based access control for Teacher, User, and Sensor accounts.

Data Integrity & Validation

Rejects invalid readings (e.g., humidity > 100%, temperature < -50¬∞C or > 60¬∞C).

Database Triggers

Logs deleted weather data into a separate collection.

Updates user last login timestamp automatically.

Data Security

Encrypted data transmission and at-rest encryption.

Restricted MongoDB roles for database access.

Performance Optimization

Indexed queries for efficient analysis (temperature, humidity, rainfall trends).

TTL index to automatically remove inactive student users after 30 days.

Scalable MongoDB Setup

Sharding/replication for distributed deployment across multiple low-power servers (e.g., Raspberry Pi).
